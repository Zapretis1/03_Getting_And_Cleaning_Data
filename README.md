To your attention-----------------You've been chosen to review this assignement. Thank you in advance for your time! I believe such peer reviewed work is both beneficial to students who submit and get thoughtful advice from their peers as well as for reviewers who can discover alternative ways of solving the same problem!As it has been emphasized on [David Hood's][david hood] webpage and in the discussion forum, reviewing should be kept simple.This is why the submission encompasses:1.	The submitted tidy dataset [`averaged_data.txt`](#averageddata); the repository contains both the text and zipped version of the file for easy [download](#download)2.	The required scripts [`run_analysis.R`](#runanalysis) which processes the data and [`setup_review.R`](#setupreview) which helps the reviewer3.	A code book [`CodeBook.md`](#codebook) which explains what the data set contains4.	The present `README.md` which explains the files mentioned hereaboveEasy reviewing--------------To make reviewing easy:1.	Copy to your computer the R scripts2.	Run [`setup_review.R`](#setupreview)3.	Run [`run_analysis.R`](#runanalysis)4.	Have a look at the [`CodeBook.md`](#codebook)5.	Have a look at the data in [`averaged_data.txt`](#averageddata)Data `averaged_data.txt` <a id="averageddata" />-----------------------This file contains the newly created dataset with averaged features with respect to both subject's who have taken part in the study and to one of the six activities they performed.The produced data can be viewed directly on the GitHub repository by clicking on the file [`averaged_data.txt`][datalink]. Data is tidy as per [Hadley Wickam's][hadley wickham] article for the following reasons:*	Data has headings*	Variables are in different columns*	There is one entry per line*	There are no duplicate columnsThe headings are descriptive in the sense that they are acronyms indicating what each feature represents in a compact formSee the `features_info.txt` of the original data for detailed explanation of what each feature represents and how it is computed.The produced data can be loaded into R using the command`data_read<- read.table("averaged_data.txt", fileEncoding = "UTF-8")`The produced data will be reloaded into R as a checking procedure at the end of the [`run_analysis.R`](#runanalysis) script.[datalink]: https://github.com/Zapretis1/03_Getting_And_Cleaning_Data/blob/master/averaged_data.txtScript `run_analysis.R` <a id="runanalysis" />-----------------------This R script called run_analysis.R does the following:1.	Loads the data into R2.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.3.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.4.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set5.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.6.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.7.	Writes the independent tidy data set in a text file8.	Checks that the created data and the exported and reimported data matchThe following operations are worth mentioning:*	Only -mean() and -meanFreq() measurements are extracted.*	Ultimate features corresponding to angle values where variables suffixed with "Mean" appear, are excluded from the extraction.*	They represent values computed based on means of gravity, gyro values.*	All columns labelled with -std() are extracted*	The letter "a" has been prepended to all the resulting variable names to remind that they are averaged values of the originally computed features.*	The precision of the data has been limited to 5 digits. Surprisingly enough, higher precision would not allow both the created data within the script and the downloaded data created with `write.table` and loaded with `read.table` to match.The R script can be viewed in the browser by clicking on the file [`run_analysis.R`][runanalysislink].[runanalysislink]: https://github.com/Zapretis1/03_Getting_And_Cleaning_Data/blob/master/run_analysis.RScript `setup_review.R` <a id="setupreview" />-----------------------This script helps the reviewer put himself in the shoes of the submitting student.It helps fellow markers setting up the environment to make peer reviewing easier, faster and straightforward.This scripts downloads the raw data in an appropriate directory and unzips the files.The user ends up with a ready-to-use environment for running the script created for the assignment [`run_analysis.R`][runanalysislink].The R script can be viewed in the browser by clicking on the file [`setup_review.R`][setupreviewlink]This script assumes R is installed on the computer (or course it is if you are reviewing this work).You can run the script `review_setup.R` from any location on your computer.The `review_setup.R` script will create a directory `03_week4_peer_graded_assignment_zapretis1` in your working directory and download and unzip the data file into it.As a result you get the directory UCI HAR Dataset with the following content and architecture (2 directories and 4 text files):*	`test` directory with test data*	`train` directory with train data*	`activity_labels.txt`*	`features.txt`*	`features_info.txt`*	`README.txt`[setupreviewlink]: https://github.com/Zapretis1/03_Getting_And_Cleaning_Data/blob/master/setup_review.RCode Book <a id="codebook" />---------The Code Book modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.The content of the Code Book can be viewed in the browser by clicking on the file [`CodeBook.md`][codebooklink][codebooklink]: https://github.com/Zapretis1/03_Getting_And_Cleaning_Data/blob/master/CodeBook.mdEncountered difficulties and possible improvements--------------------------------------------------Here is a list of conducted experimented that has not proved successful in the available time for submission:*	Automatic download <a id="manualsetup" /> of all files does not seem to be working as expected from my repository; instead of loading a text or a csv file as explained in [here][loadlink], the downloaded file contains HTML code.*	The precision of the data has been reduced in order to match written and loaded data. It is surprising that both read.table and write.table with default setings do not yield an identical result when data is produced within an R script.*	It is not really satisfactory to have manually used all the labels of the variables to compute the means; however all my attempts to run generic abstract code with the know functions to summarize data have failed...[loadlink]: https://github.com/thoughtfulbloke/faoexampleCredits-------The [Dingus][] web page for converting markdown source into html source and preview the layout.[dingus]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus "Optional Title Here"[david hood]: https://thoughtfulbloke.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/getting-and-cleaning-the-assignment/[hadley wickham]: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf[uci data]: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Optional Title Here"__EOF__
